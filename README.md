# Documentation
The goal of this repository is to assemble a knowledge base for the community to build on top of Spacetime Metaverse. For information about the project and its mission, you can read the whitepapers.

**Space Chunk policyID: 7652a254a5691f32203c093fcbd74193447c8724cadaf5e7402cf33b**

You are here extremely early in the project. Note that the Spacetime metaverse is still in its very early stages, we do not have much documentation and the code did not have any iteration of optimisation. For this reason you must stay aware that everything you read in this documentation is subject to changes and the code will evolve frequently over the next years.    

Later in the developement, there will be more aspects to customizes, but for now, there are only 2 thing you can build on top of spacetime meta, your planet and your world. For learning more, we recomend reading the documentiation in the following order:

First start with the planet (the icon on the map)
- [How to get a custom planet](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/documentation/blob/main/custom_planet.md)

Then you can custom the world inside your planet by reading the following documentation.
1. [Introduction](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/documentation/blob/main/introduction.md)
2. [Create terrain and assets](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/documentation/blob/main/Terrain_and_assets.md)
3. [Use the Cummunity Standard Kit](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/documentation/blob/main/Community_Standard_Kit.md)
4. [Host your world](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/documentation/blob/main/Host_your_world.md)
5. [Connect to the map](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/documentation/blob/main/Connect_to_the_map.md)

We strongly invite you to contribute in the developement of the Spacetime Meta ecosystem. To learn more you can read the [How to contribute](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/documentation/blob/main/contribute.md) documentation.
