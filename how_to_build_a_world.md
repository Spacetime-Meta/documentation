# how to build a world

In the end, a link to your world is the only thing you need to connect your environement to the Spacetime Meta. This mean you have no limitation on how to build your world. You can use any of the solutions proposed here or you can use your own way.

We still have to agree on the metaverse standards. One thing that is sure is that these standards will simply extend the already existing web standards and best practices. This means you wont have to use anything else than some javascript, html and css.

We strongly recomend 3D environements but you can always link to a classic 2D website like this page you are reading. Note that download links will be blacklisted.  

Here is a list of the recomended solutions to build your 3D world:
1. Build the world directly in WebGL using a js library like threejs or babylonjs.
2. Build the world using unity/unreal and export it to WebGL.
3. Use a service to create and host your world.

## Build with Three.js or Babylon.js
This is the most difficult way to build the 3D world since you will have do do a lot of coding. On the other side, this is the recomended solution if you are building app that that connects to the blockchain and/or IPFS since you will have more granular control on the code.

Examples with Threejs:: https://threejs.org/examples/ 
Examples with Babylonjs: https://www.babylonjs.com/games/ 

## Build with Unity or Unreal Engine
This solution is recomended if you are trying to build a complex game. There are many tutorials avaialable online for learning Unity and Unreal. On the downside, it might be more difficult to integrate blockchain fucntionanlities in an app generated by an export to WebGL.  

For more informations, we recommend searching youtube for introduction videos.

## Use a service.  
The is the easiest solution but it wont give you much freedom. The best known services available now are:  

1. **[Muse](https://www.muse.place/)**.  
Muse in a user-friendly metaverse creation app. One of its cool features is that they have maps like museums that you can customize easily for free. 

2. **[Spacial](https://spatial.io/)**.  
Spacial is a metaverse itself that has been in development since 2016. They have multiplayer features with live voice chat. They also offer many paying services for people who want a turnkey 3D environnement. They have a connection with metamask.
 
The consequence of using services:
These services are great to have something quickly, but you will never truly own your 3D environment. If the service provider starts charging for some features, youâ€™ll have no choice but to pay or lose your world. 

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use something else?**  
Answer is yes, you can build your stuff with the software that you want. As long as you can host your 3D environment on a webpage.The important part is that people don't have to download you game or world before playing. 

**Now that I have a virtual environement, how to connect it to spacetime meta?**
