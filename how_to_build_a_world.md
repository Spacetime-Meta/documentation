# how to build a world

In the end, a link to your world is the only thing you need to connect your environement to the Spacetime Meta. This mean you have no limitation on how to build your world. You can use any of the solutions proposed here or you can use your own way.

We strongly recomend 3D environements but you can always link to a classic 2D website like this page you are reading. Note that download links will be blacklisted.  

Here is a list of the recomended solutions to build your 3D world:
1. Build the world directly in WebGL using threejs.
2. Build the world using unity/unreal and export it to WebGL.
3. Use a service to create and host your world.

## Build with Threejs.
This is the most difficult way to build the 3D world since you will have do do a lot of coding. On the other side, this is the recomended solution if you are building app that that connects to the blockchain and/or IPFS since you will have more granular control on the code.

We still have to agree on the metaverse standards. One thing that is sure is that these standards will simply extend the already existing web standards and best practices. This means you wont have to use anything else than some javascript, html and css.

To build your metaverse assets, we recommend Blender. Any other 3D software that can export to .glb is also relevant but the fact that blender is free, open source and a non profit org makes them our number one choice in terms of 3D creation.


## Use a service.  
The is the recomended solution for the average metaverse enjoyer. The best known solutions available now are:  
1. Muse
2. Spacial
