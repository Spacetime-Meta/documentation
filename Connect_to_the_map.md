# How to update your planet and connect your world to the Spacetime Meta map.

Spacetime Meta Map Actual Official Link: https://www.spacetimemeta.io/map

**The map is still in heavy developement! Please be aware that there will be constant updates to this documentation and you might have to update your app/chunk to keep up with the latest methods**

As of 2022-02-03, the easy way to update your chunk is by using the [Nami wallet](https://namiwallet.io/).

To connect a website to the metaverse, you will need the following 5 things:

# STEP 1: Prepare your stuff

1. **IPFS hash of your 3D icon**  
This part is optional, if you dont put anything, the loader will generate a default planet for your location.
If you want to customize the appearance of your icon/planet, you will need a 3D model in the .gltf/.glb file format.  
Once loaded in the map, you model will be scaled down to 1mx1mx1m so it is recommended you keep that in mind to avoid weird scaling.  

2. **Link or IPFS hash to your project logo**  
This should be a square image, idealy 64x64.

3. **Link or IPFS hash to your banner image**  
This should be a 1920x1080 image.

4. **Link to your app**  
This is the link people will follow when entering your planet.

5. **Name to display**  
This is the short text that appears when users mouse hover your planet.

# STEP 2: Test your stuff

Once you have all 5 items, go to the icon tester at https://www.spacetimemeta.io/tester . You will see a form and need to fill it with the information you gathered earlier.
