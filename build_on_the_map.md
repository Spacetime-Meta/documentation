# How to build/customize a planet on the Spacetime Meta map.

Spacetime Meta Map Actual Official Link: https://www.spacetimemeta.io/map.html

**The map is still in heavy developement! Please be aware that there will be constant updates to this documentation and you might have to update your app/chunk to keep up with the latest methods**

As of 2022-01-28, the process is still a manual upload of your metadata to the [metadata repo](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/spacetime-metadata/blob/main/test_data). This process will be updated on the mint date.

To connect a website to the metaverse, you will need the following 4 things:
1. **Your 3D icon**  
This part is optional, if you dont put anything, the loader will generate a default planet for your location.
If you want to customize the appearance of your icon/planet, you will need a 3D model in the .gltf/.glb file format.  
Once loaded in the map, you model will be scaled down to 1mx1mx1m so it is recomemded you keep that in mind to avoid weird scaling.  

2. **Your project logo**  
This should be a square image, idealy 64x64.

3. **banner image**  
This should be a 1920x1080 image.

4. **Link to your app**  
This is the link people will follow when entering your planet.
