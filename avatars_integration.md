## Avatars (storing animating rigging)


If you plan on making avatars for the metaverse, you need to understand that one of the important parts of the standard is that we all agree on storing, animating, and rigging our avatars the same way. Until the standard is agreed on we can only suggest a way to do it without the certitude that THIS will be the standard.

Our top choices choice for rigging and animating avatars is blender and mixamo 

Blender:
You can do everything with blender. See all what you can do here:

Mixamo:
They're a web-based service that helps developers rig and animate 3D characters by making rigging and animation easier. A developer can upload the mesh for a character, place joint locators and locator rings to figure out how to make the character move, and then run Mixamo's auto-rigging software. 

They have free services but also offer a premium access for 1500$ annually for more serious game development studios.
