# Terrain an Assets
To build your metaverse terrain and assets, we recommend Blender. Any other 3D software that can export to .glb is also relevant but the fact that blender is free, open source and a non profit org makes them our number one choice in terms of 3D creation.

## Blender 

*“Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process” (from blender website)*

Blender is an extremely powerfull software and has an incredible amount of functionalities, for this reason, it is not easy for beginers. We really recommend watching some tutorials instead of going with trials and errors.  
A good starting point is the [Blender Guru tutorial serie for beginers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD). 

Once you are starting to get the feel of 3D modeling, you can start working on a world for your planet. In the end, you only need one single `.glb` file containing your whole world. [This](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/spawn-planet2.0/blob/master/glb/spawnplanet.glb) is the file used for the spawn planet world, it is a good example for a terrain you can start with.

# Terrain

The first thing your should start with is the ground of you world.

# Assets

For now you should put all your assets in the same `.glb` file as your terrain, as you can see in the [example](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/spawn-planet2.0/blob/master/glb/spawnplanet.glb)

# export

Once you are done building the world of your dreams, you can export it to `.glb`
