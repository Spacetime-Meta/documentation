# How to create metaverse assets

## Build metaverse assets in blender
To build your metaverse assets, we recommend Blender. Any other 3D software that can export to .glb is also relevant but the fact that blender is free, open source and a non profit org makes them our number one choice in terms of 3D creation.  

*“Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process”*
